You are given two integer arrays `value` and `limit`, both of length `n`.

Initially, all elements are **inactive**. You may activate them in any order.

-   To activate an inactive element at index `i`, the number of **currently** active elements must be **strictly less** than `limit[i]`.
-   When you activate the element at index `i`, it adds `value[i]` to the **total** activation value (i.e., the sum of `value[i]` for all elements that have undergone activation operations).
-   After each activation, if the number of **currently** active elements becomes `x`, then **all** elements `j` with `limit[j] ≤ x` become **permanently** inactive, even if they are already active.

Return the **maximum** **total** you can obtain by choosing the activation order optimally.

**Constraints:**

-   `1 ≤ n == value.length == limit.length ≤ 10^5`
-   `1 ≤ value[i] ≤ 10^5`
-   `1 ≤ limit[i] ≤ n`
