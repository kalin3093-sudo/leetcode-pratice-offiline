You are given two integers `w` and `m`, and an integer array `arrivals`, where `arrivals[i]` is the type of item arriving on day `i` (days are **1-indexed**).

Items are managed according to the following rules:

-   Each arrival may be **kept** or **discarded**; an item may only be discarded on its arrival day.
-   For each day `i`, consider the window of days `[max(1, i - w + 1), i]` (the `w` most recent days up to day `i`):
    -   For **any** such window, each item type may appear **at most** `m` times among kept arrivals whose arrival day lies in that window.
    -   If keeping the arrival on day `i` would cause its type to appear **more than** `m` times in the window, that arrival **must** be discarded.

Return the **minimum** number of arrivals to be discarded so that every `w`\-day window contains at most `m` occurrences of each type.

**Constraints:**

-   `1 ≤ arrivals.length ≤ 10^5`
-   `1 ≤ arrivals[i] ≤ 10^5`
-   `1 ≤ w ≤ arrivals.length`
-   `1 ≤ m ≤ w`
