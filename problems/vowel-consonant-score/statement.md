You are given a string `s` consisting of lowercase English letters, spaces, and digits.

Let `v` be the number of vowels in `s` and `c` be the number of consonants in `s`.

A vowel is one of the letters `'a'`, `'e'`, `'i'`, `'o'`, or `'u'`, while any other letter in the English alphabet is considered a consonant.

The **score** of the string `s` is defined as follows:

-   If `c > 0`, the `score = floor(v / c)` where floor denotes **rounding down** to the nearest integer.
-   Otherwise, the `score = 0`.

Return an integer denoting the score of the string.

**Constraints:**

-   `1 ≤ s.length ≤ 100`
-   `s` consists of lowercase English letters, spaces and digits.
