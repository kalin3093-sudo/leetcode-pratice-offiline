You are given an integer array `nums` of even length `n`.

A **cyclic rotation** of `nums` is obtained by choosing a prefix of `nums` whose length is between 0 and `n - 1` (inclusive), and moving it to the end of the array while preserving the order of all elements.

A cyclic rotation is **good** if the sum of its first `n / 2` elements is **strictly greater** than the sum of its last `n / 2` elements.

Return the number of cyclic rotations of `nums` that are good.

**Constraints:**

-   `2 ≤ n == nums.length ≤ 10^5`
-   `1 ≤ nums[i] ≤ 10^9`
-   `n` is even.
