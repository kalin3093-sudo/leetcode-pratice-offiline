You are given a string `s` consisting of lowercase English letters.

You **must** repeatedly perform the following operation while the string `s` has **at least** two **consecutive** characters:

-   Remove the **leftmost** pair of **adjacent** characters in the string that are **consecutive** in the alphabet, in either order (e.g., `'a'` and `'b'`, or `'b'` and `'a'`).
-   Shift the remaining characters to the left to fill the gap.

Return the resulting string after no more operations can be performed.

**Note:** Consider the alphabet as circular, thus `'a'` and `'z'` are consecutive.

**Constraints:**

-   `1 ≤ s.length ≤ 10^5`
-   `s` consists only of lowercase English letters.
