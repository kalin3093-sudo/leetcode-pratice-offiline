You are given an integer array `weight` of length `n`, representing the weights of `n` parcels arranged in a straight line. A **shipment** is defined as a contiguous subarray of parcels. A shipment is considered **balanced** if the weight of the **last parcel** is **strictly less** than the **maximum weight** among all parcels in that shipment.

Select a set of **non-overlapping**, contiguous, balanced shipments such that **each parcel appears in at most one shipment** (parcels may remain unshipped).

Return the **maximum possible number** of balanced shipments that can be formed.

**Constraints:**

-   `2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5`
-   `1 ≤ weight[i] ≤ 10^9`
