You are given `n × m` grid and an integer `k`.

A sensor placed on cell `(r, c)` covers all cells whose **Chebyshev distance** from `(r, c)` is **at most** `k`.

The **Chebyshev distance** between two cells `(r1, c1)` and `(r2, c2)` is `max(|r1 − r2|,|c1 − c2|)`.

Your task is to return the **minimum** number of sensors required to cover every cell of the grid.

**Constraints:**

-   `1 ≤ n ≤ 10^3`
-   `1 ≤ m ≤ 10^3`
-   `0 ≤ k ≤ 10^3`
