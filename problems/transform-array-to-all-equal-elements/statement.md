You are given an integer array `nums` of size `n` containing only `1` and `-1`, and an integer `k`.

You can perform the following operation at most `k` times:

-   Choose an index `i` (`0 ≤ i < n - 1`), and **multiply** both `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` by `-1`.
    

**Note** that you can choose the same index `i` more than once in **different** operations.

Return `true` if it is possible to make all elements of the array **equal** after at most `k` operations, and `false` otherwise.

**Constraints:**

-   `1 ≤ n == nums.length ≤ 10^5`
-   `nums[i]` is either -1 or 1.
-   `1 ≤ k ≤ n`
