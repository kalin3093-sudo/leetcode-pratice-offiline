You are given a string `s` consisting of characters `'U'`, `'D'`, `'L'`, and `'R'`, representing moves on an infinite 2D Cartesian grid.

-   `'U'`: Move from `(x, y)` to `(x, y + 1)`.
-   `'D'`: Move from `(x, y)` to `(x, y - 1)`.
-   `'L'`: Move from `(x, y)` to `(x - 1, y)`.
-   `'R'`: Move from `(x, y)` to `(x + 1, y)`.

You are also given a positive integer `k`.

You **must** choose and remove **exactly one** contiguous substring of length `k` from `s`. Then, start from coordinate `(0, 0)` and perform the remaining moves in order.

Return an integer denoting the number of **distinct** final coordinates reachable.

**Constraints:**

-   `1 ≤ s.length ≤ 10^5`
-   `s` consists of only `'U'`, `'D'`, `'L'`, and `'R'`.
-   `1 ≤ k ≤ s.length`
