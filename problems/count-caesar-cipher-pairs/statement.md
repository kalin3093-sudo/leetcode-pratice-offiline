You are given an array `words` of `n` strings. Each string has length `m` and contains only lowercase English letters.

Two strings `s` and `t` are **similar** if we can apply the following operation any number of times (possibly zero times) so that `s` and `t` become **equal**.

-   Choose either `s` or `t`.
-   Replace **every** letter in the chosen string with the next letter in the alphabet cyclically. The next letter after `'z'` is `'a'`.

Count the number of pairs of indices `(i, j)` such that:

-   `i < j`
-   `words[i]` and `words[j]` are **similar**.

Return an integer denoting the number of such pairs.

**Constraints:**

-   `1 ≤ n == words.length ≤ 10^5`
-   `1 ≤ m == words[i].length ≤ 10^5`
-   `1 ≤ n * m ≤ 10^5`
-   `words[i]` consists only of lowercase English letters.
