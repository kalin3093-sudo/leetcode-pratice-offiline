You are given an integer array `nums` with **distinct** elements.

A subarray `nums[l...r]` of `nums` is called a **bowl** if:

-   The subarray has length at least 3. That is, `r - l + 1 ≥ 3`.
-   The **minimum** of its two ends is **strictly greater** than the **maximum** of all elements in between. That is, `min(nums[l], nums[r]) > max(nums[l + 1], ..., nums[r - 1])`.

Return the number of **bowl** subarrays in `nums`.

**Constraints:**

-   `3 ≤ nums.length ≤ 10^5`
-   `1 ≤ nums[i] ≤ 10^9`
-   `nums` consists of distinct elements.
