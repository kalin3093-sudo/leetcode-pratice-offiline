You are given an integer array `nums` and two integers, `k` and `limit`. Your task is to find a non-empty **subsequence** of `nums` that:

-   Has an **alternating sum** equal to `k`.
-   **Maximizes** the product of all its numbers *without the product exceeding* `limit`.

Return the *product* of the numbers in such a subsequence. If no subsequence satisfies the requirements, return -1.

The **alternating sum** of a **0-indexed** array is defined as the **sum** of the elements at **even** indices **minus** the **sum** of the elements at **odd** indices.

**Constraints:**

-   `1 ≤ nums.length ≤ 150`
-   `0 ≤ nums[i] ≤ 12`
-   `-10^5 ≤ k ≤ 10^5`
-   `1 ≤ limit ≤ 5000`
