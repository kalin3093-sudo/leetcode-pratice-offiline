You are given an integer array `nums` of length `n` where each element is a non-negative integer.

Select **two** subsequences of `nums` (they may be empty and are **allowed** to **overlap**), each preserving the original order of elements, and let:

-   `X` be the bitwise XOR of all elements in the first subsequence.
-   `Y` be the bitwise XOR of all elements in the second subsequence.

Return the **maximum** possible value of `X XOR Y`.

**Note:** The XOR of an **empty** subsequence is 0.

**Constraints:**

-   `2 ≤ nums.length ≤ 10^5`
-   `0 ≤ nums[i] ≤ 10^9`
