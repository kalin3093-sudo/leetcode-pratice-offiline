You are given a string `s` and an integer `k`.

In one operation, you can replace the character at any position with the next or previous letter in the alphabet (wrapping around so that `'a'` is after `'z'`). For example, replacing `'a'` with the next letter results in `'b'`, and replacing `'a'` with the previous letter results in `'z'`. Similarly, replacing `'z'` with the next letter results in `'a'`, and replacing `'z'` with the previous letter results in `'y'`.

Return the length of the **longest palindromic subsequence** of `s` that can be obtained after performing **at most** `k` operations.

**Constraints:**

-   `1 ≤ s.length ≤ 200`
-   `1 ≤ k ≤ 200`
-   `s` consists of only lowercase English letters.
