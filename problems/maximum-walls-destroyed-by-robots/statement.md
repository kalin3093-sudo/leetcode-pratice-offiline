There is an endless straight line populated with some robots and walls. You are given integer arrays `robots`, `distance`, and `walls`:

-   `robots[i]` is the position of the `i^th` robot.
-   `distance[i]` is the **maximum** distance the `i^th` robot's bullet can travel.
-   `walls[j]` is the position of the `j^th` wall.

Every robot has **one** bullet that can either fire to the left or the right **at most** `distance[i]` meters.

A bullet destroys every wall in its path that lies within its range. Robots are fixed obstacles: if a bullet hits another robot before reaching a wall, it **immediately stops** at that robot and cannot continue.

Return the **maximum** number of **unique** walls that can be destroyed by the robots.

Notes:

-   A wall and a robot may share the same position; the wall can be destroyed by the robot at that position.
-   Robots are not destroyed by bullets.

**Constraints:**

-   `1 ≤ robots.length == distance.length ≤ 10^5`
-   `1 ≤ walls.length ≤ 10^5`
-   `1 ≤ robots[i], walls[j] ≤ 10^9`
-   `1 ≤ distance[i] ≤ 10^5`
-   All values in `robots` are **unique**
-   All values in `walls` are **unique**
