Given a string `s`, partition it into **unique segments** according to the following procedure:

-   Start building a segment beginning at index 0.
-   Continue extending the current segment character by character until the current segment has not been seen before.
-   Once the segment is unique, add it to your list of segments, mark it as seen, and begin a new segment from the next index.
-   Repeat until you reach the end of `s`.

Return an array of strings `segments`, where `segments[i]` is the `i^th` segment created.

**Constraints:**

-   `1 ≤ s.length ≤ 10^5`
-   `s` contains only lowercase English letters.
