You are given two integer arrays, `technique1` and `technique2`, each of length `n`, where `n` represents the number of tasks to complete.

-   If the `i^th` task is completed using technique 1, you earn `technique1[i]` points.
-   If it is completed using technique 2, you earn `technique2[i]` points.

You are also given an integer `k`, representing the **minimum** number of tasks that **must** be completed using technique 1.

You **must** complete **at least** `k` tasks using technique 1 (they do not need to be the first `k` tasks).

The remaining tasks may be completed using **either** technique.

Return an integer denoting the **maximum total points** you can earn.

**Constraints:**

-   `1 ≤ n == technique1.length == technique2.length ≤ 10^5`
-   `1 ≤ technique1[i], technique2[i] ≤ 10^5`
-   `0 ≤ k ≤ n`
