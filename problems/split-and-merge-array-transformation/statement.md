You are given two integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2`, each of length `n`. You may perform the following **split-and-merge operation** on `nums1` any number of times:

1.  Choose a subarray `nums1[L..R]`.
2.  Remove that subarray, leaving the prefix `nums1[0..L-1]` (empty if `L = 0`) and the suffix `nums1[R+1..n-1]` (empty if `R = n - 1`).
3.  Re-insert the removed subarray (in its original order) at **any** position in the remaining array (i.e., between any two elements, at the very start, or at the very end).

Return the **minimum** number of **split-and-merge operations** needed to transform `nums1` into `nums2`.

**Constraints:**

-   `2 ≤ n == nums1.length == nums2.length ≤ 6`
-   `-10^5 ≤ nums1[i], nums2[i] ≤ 10^5`
-   `nums2` is a **permutation** of `nums1`.
