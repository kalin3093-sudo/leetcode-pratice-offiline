You are given an integer array `nums`. Your task is to remove **all elements** from the array by performing one of the following operations at each step until `nums` is empty:

-   Choose any two elements from the first three elements of `nums` and remove them. The cost of this operation is the **maximum** of the two elements removed.
-   If fewer than three elements remain in `nums`, remove all the remaining elements in a single operation. The cost of this operation is the **maximum** of the remaining elements.

Return the **minimum** cost required to remove all the elements.

**Constraints:**

-   `1 ≤ nums.length ≤ 1000`
-   `1 ≤ nums[i] ≤ 10^6`
