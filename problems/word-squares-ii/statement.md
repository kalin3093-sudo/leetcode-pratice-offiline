You are given a string array `words`, consisting of **distinct** 4-letter strings, each containing lowercase English letters.

A **word square** consists of 4 **distinct** words: `top`, `left`, `right` and `bottom`, arranged as follows:

-   `top` forms the **top row**.
-   `bottom` forms the **bottom row**.
-   `left` forms the **left column** (top to bottom).
-   `right` forms the **right column** (top to bottom).

It must satisfy:

-   `top[0] == left[0]`, `top[3] == right[0]`
-   `bottom[0] == left[3]`, `bottom[3] == right[3]`

Return all valid **distinct** word squares, sorted in **ascending lexicographic** order by the 4-tuple `(top, left, right, bottom)`.

**Constraints:**

-   `4 ≤ words.length ≤ 15`
-   `words[i].length == 4`
-   `words[i]` consists of only lowercase English letters.
-   All `words[i]` are **distinct**.
