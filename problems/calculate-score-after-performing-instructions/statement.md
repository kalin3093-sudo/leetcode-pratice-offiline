You are given two arrays, `instructions` and `values`, both of size `n`.

You need to simulate a process based on the following rules:

-   You start at the first instruction at index `i = 0` with an initial score of 0.
-   If `instructions[i]` is `"add"`:
    -   Add `values[i]` to your score.
    -   Move to the next instruction `(i + 1)`.
-   If `instructions[i]` is `"jump"`:
    -   Move to the instruction at index `(i + values[i])` without modifying your score.

The process ends when you either:

-   Go out of bounds (i.e., `i < 0 or i ≥ n`), or
-   Attempt to revisit an instruction that has been previously executed. The revisited instruction is not executed.

Return your score at the end of the process.

**Constraints:**

-   `n == instructions.length == values.length`
-   `1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5`
-   `instructions[i]` is either `"add"` or `"jump"`.
-   `-10^5 ≤ values[i] ≤ 10^5`
