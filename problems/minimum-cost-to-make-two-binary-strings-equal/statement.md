You are given two binary strings `s` and `t`, both of length `n`, and three **positive** integers `flipCost`, `swapCost`, and `crossCost`.

You are allowed to apply the following operations any number of times (in any order) to the strings `s` and `t`:

-   Choose any index `i` and flip `s[i]` or `t[i]` (change `'0'` to `'1'` or `'1'` to `'0'`). The cost of this operation is `flipCost`.
-   Choose two **distinct** indices `i` and `j`, and swap either `s[i]` and `s[j]` or `t[i]` and `t[j]`. The cost of this operation is `swapCost`.
-   Choose an index `i` and swap `s[i]` with `t[i]`. The cost of this operation is `crossCost`.

Return an integer denoting the **minimum** total cost needed to make the strings `s` and `t` equal.

**Constraints:**

-   `n == s.length == t.length`
-   `1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5`
-   `1 ≤ flipCost, swapCost, crossCost ≤ 10^9`
-   `s` and `t` consist only of the characters `'0'` and `'1'`.
