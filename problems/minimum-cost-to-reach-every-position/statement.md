You are given an integer array `cost` of size `n`. You are currently at position `n` (at the end of the line) in a line of `n + 1` people (numbered from 0 to `n`).

You wish to move forward in the line, but each person in front of you charges a specific amount to **swap** places. The cost to swap with person `i` is given by `cost[i]`.

You are allowed to swap places with people as follows:

-   If they are in front of you, you **must** pay them `cost[i]` to swap with them.
-   If they are behind you, they can swap with you for free.

Return an array `answer` of size `n`, where `answer[i]` is the **minimum** total cost to reach each position `i` in the line.

**Constraints:**

-   `1 ≤ n == cost.length ≤ 100`
-   `1 ≤ cost[i] ≤ 100`
