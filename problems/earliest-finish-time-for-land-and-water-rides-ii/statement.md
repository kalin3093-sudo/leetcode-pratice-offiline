You are given two categories of theme park attractions: **land rides** and **water rides**.

-   **Land rides**
    -   `landStartTime[i]` – the earliest time the `i^th` land ride can be boarded.
    -   `landDuration[i]` – how long the `i^th` land ride lasts.
-   **Water rides**
    -   `waterStartTime[j]` – the earliest time the `j^th` water ride can be boarded.
    -   `waterDuration[j]` – how long the `j^th` water ride lasts.

A tourist must experience **exactly one** ride from **each** category, in **either order**.

-   A ride may be started at its opening time or **any later moment**.
-   If a ride is started at time `t`, it finishes at time `t + duration`.
-   Immediately after finishing one ride the tourist may board the other (if it is already open) or wait until it opens.

Return the **earliest possible time** at which the tourist can finish both rides.

**Constraints:**

-   `1 ≤ n, m ≤ 5 * 10^4`
-   `landStartTime.length == landDuration.length == n`
-   `waterStartTime.length == waterDuration.length == m`
-   `1 ≤ landStartTime[i], landDuration[i], waterStartTime[j], waterDuration[j] ≤ 10^5`
