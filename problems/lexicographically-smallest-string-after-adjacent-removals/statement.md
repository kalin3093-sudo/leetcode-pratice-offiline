You are given a string `s` consisting of lowercase English letters.

You can perform the following operation any number of times (including zero):

-   Remove **any** pair of **adjacent** characters in the string that are **consecutive** in the alphabet, in either order (e.g., `'a'` and `'b'`, or `'b'` and `'a'`).
-   Shift the remaining characters to the left to fill the gap.

Return the **lexicographically smallest** string that can be obtained after performing the operations optimally.

**Note:** Consider the alphabet as circular, thus `'a'` and `'z'` are consecutive.

**Constraints:**

-   `1 ≤ s.length ≤ 250`
-   `s` consists only of lowercase English letters.
