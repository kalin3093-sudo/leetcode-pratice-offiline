You are given an integer array `nums`.

For each element `nums[i]`, you may perform the following operations **any** number of times (including zero):

-   Increase `nums[i]` by 1, or
-   Decrease `nums[i]` by 1.

A number is called a **binary palindrome** if its binary representation without leading zeros reads the same forward and backward.

Your task is to return an integer array `ans`, where `ans[i]` represents the **minimum** number of operations required to convert `nums[i]` into a **binary palindrome**.

**Constraints:**

-   `1 ≤ nums.length ≤ 5000`
-   `1 ≤ nums[i] ≤ 5000`
