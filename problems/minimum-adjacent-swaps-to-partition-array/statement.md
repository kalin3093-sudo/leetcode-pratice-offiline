You are given an integer array `nums` and two integers `a` and `b` such that `a < b`.

An array is called **good** if it can be split into three **contiguous** parts, in this order, such that:

-   Every element in the first part is **less than** `a`.
-   Every element in the second part is **in** the range `[a, b]` inclusive.
-   Every element in the third part is **greater than** `b`.

Any of the three parts **may be** empty.

In one **adjacent swap**, you may swap two **neighboring** elements of `nums`.

Return the **minimum number** of adjacent swaps required to make `nums` good. Since the answer may be very large, return it **modulo** `10^9 + 7`.

**Constraints:**

-   `1 ≤ nums.length ≤ 10^5`
-   `1 ≤ nums[i] ≤ 10^9`
-   `1 ≤ a < b ≤ 10^9`
