You are given a string `s` consisting of lowercase English letters and the special characters: `'*'`, `'#'`, and `'%'`.

You are also given an integer `k`.

Build a new string `result` by processing `s` according to the following rules from left to right:

-   If the letter is a **lowercase** English letter append it to `result`.
-   A `'*'` **removes** the last character from `result`, if it exists.
-   A `'#'` **duplicates** the current `result` and **appends** it to itself.
-   A `'%'` **reverses** the current `result`.

Return the `k^th` character of the final string `result`. If `k` is out of the bounds of `result`, return `'.'`.

**Constraints:**

-   `1 ≤ s.length ≤ 10^5`
-   `s` consists of only lowercase English letters and special characters `'*'`, `'#'`, and `'%'`.
-   `0 ≤ k ≤ 10^15`
-   The length of `result` after processing `s` will not exceed `10^15`.
