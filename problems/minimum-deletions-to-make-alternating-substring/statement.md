You are given a string `s` of length `n` consisting only of the characters `'A'` and `'B'`.

You are also given a 2D integer array `queries` of length `q`, where each `queries[i]` is one of the following:

-   `[1, j]`: **Flip** the character at index `j` of `s` i.e. `'A'` changes to `'B'` (and vice versa). This operation mutates `s` and affects subsequent queries.
-   `[2, l, r]`: **Compute** the **minimum** number of character deletions required to make the **substring** `s[l..r]` **alternating**. This operation does not modify `s`; the length of `s` remains `n`.

A **substring** is **alternating** if no two **adjacent** characters are **equal**. A substring of length 1 is always alternating.

Return an integer array `answer`, where `answer[i]` is the result of the `i^th` query of type `[2, l, r]`.

**Constraints:**

-   `1 ≤ n == s.length ≤ 10^5`
-   `s[i]` is either `'A'` or `'B'`.
-   `1 ≤ q == queries.length ≤ 10^5`
-   `queries[i].length == 2` or `3`
    -   `queries[i] == [1, j]` or,
    -   `queries[i] == [2, l, r]`
    -   `0 ≤ j ≤ n - 1`
    -   `0 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n - 1`
