You are given an integer array `nums` and two **distinct** integers `target1` and `target2`.

A **partition** of `nums` splits it into one or more **contiguous, non-empty** blocks that cover the entire array without overlap.

A partition is **valid** if the **bitwise XOR** of elements in its blocks **alternates** between `target1` and `target2`, starting with `target1`.

Formally, for blocks `b1`, `b2`, …:

-   `XOR(b1) = target1`
-   `XOR(b2) = target2` (if it exists)
-   `XOR(b3) = target1`, and so on.

Return the number of valid partitions of `nums`, modulo `10^9 + 7`.

**Note:** A single block is valid if its **XOR** equals `target1`.

**Constraints:**

-   `1 ≤ nums.length ≤ 10^5`
-   `0 ≤ nums[i], target1, target2 ≤ 10^5`
-   `target1 != target2`
