You are given an integer array `nums`, and an integer `k`.

Start with an initial value `val = 1` and process `nums` from left to right. At each index `i`, you must choose **exactly one** of the following actions:

-   Multiply `val` by `nums[i]`.
-   Divide `val` by `nums[i]`.
-   Leave `val` unchanged.

After processing all elements, `val` is considered **equal** to `k` only if its final rational value **exactly** equals `k`.

Return the count of **distinct** sequences of choices that result in `val == k`.

**Note:** Division is rational (exact), not integer division. For example, `2 / 4 = 1 / 2`.

**Constraints:**

-   `1 ≤ nums.length ≤ 19`
-   `1 ≤ nums[i] ≤ 6`
-   `1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15`
