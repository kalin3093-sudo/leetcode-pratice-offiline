You are given an array of positive integers `nums` and a positive integer `k`.

A permutation of `nums` is said to form a **divisible concatenation** if, when you *concatenate* *the decimal representations* of the numbers in the order specified by the permutation, the resulting number is **divisible by** `k`.

Return the **lexicographically smallest** permutation (when considered as a list of integers) that forms a **divisible concatenation**. If no such permutation exists, return an empty list.

**Constraints:**

-   `1 ≤ nums.length ≤ 13`
-   `1 ≤ nums[i] ≤ 10^5`
-   `1 ≤ k ≤ 100`
