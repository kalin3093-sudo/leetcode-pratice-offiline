You are given a string `caption` representing the caption for a video.

The following actions must be performed **in order** to generate a **valid tag** for the video:

1.  **Combine all words** in the string into a single *camelCase string* prefixed with `'#'`. A *camelCase string* is one where the first letter of all words *except* the first one is capitalized. All characters after the first character in **each** word must be lowercase.
    
2.  **Remove** all characters that are not an English letter, **except** the first `'#'`.
    
3.  **Truncate** the result to a maximum of 100 characters.
    

Return the **tag** after performing the actions on `caption`.

**Constraints:**

-   `1 ≤ caption.length ≤ 150`
-   `caption` consists only of English letters and `' '`.
