You are given two integer arrays `nums1` of length `n` and `nums2` of length `n + 1`.

You want to transform `nums1` into `nums2` using the **minimum** number of operations.

You may perform the following operations **any** number of times, each time choosing an index `i`:

-   **Increase** `nums1[i]` by 1.
-   **Decrease** `nums1[i]` by 1.
-   **Append** `nums1[i]` to the **end** of the array.

Return the **minimum** number of operations required to transform `nums1` into `nums2`.

**Constraints:**

-   `1 ≤ n == nums1.length ≤ 10^5`
-   `nums2.length == n + 1`
-   `1 ≤ nums1[i], nums2[i] ≤ 10^5`
