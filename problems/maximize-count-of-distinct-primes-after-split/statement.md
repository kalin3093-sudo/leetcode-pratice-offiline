You are given an integer array `nums` having length `n` and a 2D integer array `queries` where `queries[i] = [idx, val]`.

For each query:

1.  Update `nums[idx] = val`.
2.  Choose an integer `k` with `1 ≤ k < n` to split the array into the non-empty prefix `nums[0..k-1]` and suffix `nums[k..n-1]` such that the sum of the counts of **distinct** prime values in each part is **maximum**.

**Note:** The changes made to the array in one query persist into the next query.

Return an array containing the result for each query, in the order they are given.

**Constraints:**

-   `2 ≤ n == nums.length ≤ 5 * 10^4`
-   `1 ≤ queries.length ≤ 5 * 10^4`
-   `1 ≤ nums[i] ≤ 10^5`
-   `0 ≤ queries[i][0] < nums.length`
-   `1 ≤ queries[i][1] ≤ 10^5`
