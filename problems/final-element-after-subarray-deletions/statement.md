You are given an integer array `nums`.

Two players, Alice and Bob, play a game in turns, with Alice playing first.

-   In each turn, the current player chooses any **subarray** `nums[l..r]` such that `r - l + 1 < m`, where `m` is the **current length** of the array.
-   The selected **subarray is removed**, and the remaining elements are **concatenated** to form the new array.
-   The game continues until **only one** element remains.

Alice aims to **maximize** the final element, while Bob aims to **minimize** it. Assuming both play optimally, return the value of the final remaining element.

**Constraints:**

-   `1 ≤ nums.length ≤ 10^5`
-   `1 ≤ nums[i] ≤ 10^5`
