You are given an integer array `nums`.

Two players are playing a game with this array: Player 1 and Player 2.

Player 1 and Player 2 take turns, with Player 1 starting first. Both players start the game with a score of 0.

At each turn, the current player takes the number at **either end** of the array (i.e., `nums[0]` or `nums[nums.length - 1]`), **removing** it from the array and adding it to their own score. The game ends when there are no more elements in the array.

Return `true` if Player 1's final score is **greater than or equal** to Player 2's final score, and `false` otherwise.

**Note** that a tie counts as a win for Player 1. You may assume that both players play optimally.

**Constraints:**

-   `1 ≤ nums.length ≤ 20`
-   `0 ≤ nums[i] ≤ 10^7`
